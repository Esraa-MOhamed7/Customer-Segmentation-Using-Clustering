# ‚ú®Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

Welcome! This project explores customer segmentation using clustering techniques to uncover meaningful patterns in mall customer data. It‚Äôs designed to be beginner-friendly, modular, and easy to follow ‚Äî perfect for learners, marketers, and recruiters.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Group customers into distinct segments based on behavior and demographics  
- **Dataset**: Mall Customer Dataset (includes Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score)  
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Visual Interpretation of Segments

## üñºÔ∏è Visualizations

### Before Clustering (EDA)
These help explore the raw data and understand feature distributions:
- `countplot`: Gender distribution
- `histplot`: Age, Income, and Spending Score distributions
- `boxplot`: Spending Score by Gender
- `scatterplot`: Income vs. Spending Score

###  After Clustering
These reveal how clustering separates customer groups:
- `scatterplot`: Clustered segments (color-coded)
- `centroid plot`: Cluster centers
- `boxplot`: Feature distributions by cluster
- `heatmap`: Average feature values per cluster
- `pairplot`: Feature relationships across clusters
